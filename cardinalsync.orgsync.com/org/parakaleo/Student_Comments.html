<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">Fortunately, God has given us His Word as a manual for living. For 40 years, Steve and Erica Lawry have been teaching wisdom from God&#39;s Word and showing its applicability to everyday life at the Biblical Counseling Course. When I attended the course last winter, a classmate asked me, &quot;So, at this class, are you being counseled, or are you learning how to counsel?&quot; I replied that the answer was &quot;Both!&quot; As we learn to counsel others from Scripture, we necessarily find that the Bible not only provides the most effective counsel for the world&#39;s problems, but also our own as well.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">I can&#39;t say enough good things about the personal and spiritual benefits of this class! It is for practical folks who are interested in learning more about God&#39;s word from a new perspective, for those looking for Biblical tools to help &#39;counsel&#39; others, and for those who wonder how God&#39;s word can apply to their every-day life.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">If you&#39;re not sure you want to commit, no worries. Just set aside a bit of time next Wednesday evening and go check it out. There is no pressure to sign up -- you won&#39;t be disappointed!!</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">This is not your ordinary Bible study. More than any other Bible study I have attended, this course explains how the Bible so powerfully applies to every aspect of our daily (and often messy) lives. When I attended the course during the past winter and spring quarters, I was often taken aback about what the Bible had to say about certain issues---it was so incredibly profound, so beyond what I would expect from even the wisest people, that at once I became convicted at the heart that the Bible is truly God&#39;s Word to man.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">Both Steve and Erica have special gifts to help bring these profound insights in the Bible to light. Steve is one of the most careful expositors of the Scriptures that I know, and Erica has her own sweet way of sharing how these Scriptures apply to our down-to-earth lives. The examples given are often taken from their own experiences and struggles, and they are very specific and practical. What I especially enjoyed was how both shared funny situations (at least in hindsight!) that all of us deal with, but somehow are seldom communicated with clarity in a large group setting.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">As Christians at Stanford, we have an amazing opportunity to influence those around us through our faith, yet often we may feel unequipped for this task. The Biblical Counseling Course at Stanford is a great place to be outfitted as an effective Christian, to learn how the Bible can empower us to face difficult counseling issues in our lives and the lives of our friends, families, and acquaintances.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">Taught by Steve and Erica Lawry, the Biblical Counseling Course is a year-long, once-a-week course that aims to make the Bible a useful manual for living for Christians. Steve and Erica&mdash;both Stanford graduates&mdash;have taught this course for over 30 years, giving them unique wisdom and perspective on the Stanford community. Using both examples of their own counseling experiences and insights from their personal studies in the course, the Lawrys&#39; study of the Word is both infectious and exciting. Autumn quarter is devoted to individual counseling issues, Winter quarter examines counseling interpersonal relationships, and Spring quarter explores counseling issues explicitly related to male-female relationships. Start at any time, but beware, you will soon be hooked!</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">The heart of the course is the story of God&#39;s redemptive nature, worked out in our salvation and evident in our relationships. Beginning in Genesis with a look at fallen human tendencies and traits, the course moves into an in-depth look at the power of God&#39;s redemptive love in freeing us from our fallen nature, and from there discusses how our new lives in Christ can be lived out relationally with those around us. The Biblical Counseling Course really does make the Bible a manual for living, equipping students with the knowledge of key passages and themes for living application, and gives the confidence to approach difficult issues from a scriptural standpoint.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">For me, the Biblical Counseling Course has been a wonderful blessing in my life, restoring to me a deep appreciation of the Bible&#39;s power as an amazing resource for living. All too often, God&#39;s Word is unfortunately transformed into a mere academic text or an aloof religious treatise. The course restores the Bible to its full power, showing both the amazing intricacy of God&#39;s Word as well as its accessibility and applicability in our own lives. The Bible took on new meaning for me, as it helped me to understand how to approach difficult problems Biblically, such as overcoming bad habits, a flagging prayer life, and day-to-day relationships with roommates, family and friends. Additionally, the Course delves into a fascinating study of nature of human beings and our God-inspired image and how the sinful corruption of our relationship with God and the world is at the heart of the most challenging counseling issues we face, as well as how the redeemed relationship of the believer with God enables us to walk in victorious new life. In my opinion, the Biblical Counseling Course is a must-take for every Christian at Stanford-an experience that will confirm your faith, challenge your lifestyle, impact those in your life, and restore to you a hunger for knowing Him.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">To me, the best thing about the class is that the teaching comes from the Bible, and the Lawrys illustrate how these truths can and should be successfully applied to many of the common issues we and our friends face daily. Personally, I think the title could be somewhat misleading, as we typically associate counseling with human efforts to find our &quot;true inner being&quot; or something fuzzy like that, or to help people put on band-aids so they become more optimistic about situations.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">Rather, I would describe it as Bible exposition from key scriptures that help us understand how the Lord has fashioned us and how we are to relate to Him and to others. The material in the class has helped me appreciate the beauty of God&#39;s design and the magnificence of the Word. Thus, it is not just useful for addressing problems and issues; it helps us live with greater fulness and appreciation. I have found myself sharing these truths with seekers, as well, because there is so much that any person can relate to. For many, it&#39;s a surprise that the Bible speaks clearly on situations we think are peculiar to our day or our own lives.</span></span></p>
