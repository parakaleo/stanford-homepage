  <h5>Biblical Counseling Course (Fall 2019)</h5>
  <p>
  We are eager to dig into the riches of 2 Corinthians 1-7 this fall, as
  we see together:
  </p>

  How the Lord uses the challenges of life, both circumstantial and
  relational

  <ul>
    <li>to greatly deepen our walks with Him</li>

    <li>to grow in His character in practice</li>

    <li>and to be equipped to help a lifetime of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  We will be learning from the Lord through this description from Paul of the
  fundamental principles of his ministry including how to seek reconciliation in
  relations strained by misunderstanding.
  </p>

  <p>
  Join us and spread the word by inviting others who may benefit as well as we
  learn together through a combination of presentation and interactive
  participation, also developing helpful methods and techniques for feeding
  oneself effectively and fruitfully on God's word.
  </p>

  <!--
  <p>
  Come join us for a year of rich feeding on
  God's word and growth in your vital
  relationship with Jesus by His Spirit in
  wisdom for managing the challenges of life
  and building healthy, fruitful relationships.
