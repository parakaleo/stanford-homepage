            <li>A chance to explore what the Bible says about the practical issues of everyday life</li>

          </ul>

          <br><h3>Course Details:</h3><hr>
          <p>The Biblical Counseling Course is a unique extracurricular course
          that covers practical personal life and counseling issues from an
          entirely Biblical perspective. The Biblical Counseling Course at
          Stanford is free and available to all undergraduate and grad
          students, faculty, university and ministry staff. Participants attend
          numerous different churches and various on-campus fellowships. The
          course is currently presented in the form of an in-depth, application
          oriented Bible study and combines presentation and interactive
          discussion of the material.</p>
          <p>You do not have to register or pay for the course. Come and join
          the course anytime.</p>

          <strong>Part 1: Growth and Change from the Heart</strong>
          <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The course begins with amazing insights into who and why we are as
          human beings from the early chapters of Genesis. What motivates,
          interests and frustrates us lead into understanding the very
          practical dynamics of how the new life in Christ enables us as
          believers to grow and change (not so much the "what" but the "how",
          explained in depth in the heart of Romans) as Jesus restores us by
          the working of His indwelling Spirit. We apply what we learn to
          comprehending why we sometimes feel defeated or depressed, and how we
          are prone to habits and additions that undermine our priorities,
          relationships, and spiritual life. Most importantly, we then learn
          how to overcome these feelings and habits in practice, so that we can
          be free to live our lives for God.</p>

          <strong>Part 2: Fruitful Interpersonal Relationships</strong>
          <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Relationships are at once one of the most rewarding and
          frustrating of all our endeavors. As any relationship deepens,
          whether it be a friend, roommate, or family member, conflict
          inevitably rises. People annoy and hurt us, and we annoy and hurt
          others, often without knowing it. Confronting the other person is
          tricky; although we would like to let the other person know what they
          are doing, we don't want to hurt the other person, experience a
          backlash, or make things worse. In this section, we'll study how the
          Bible addresses these practical issues. We'll learn when
          confrontation is appropriate, and if so, how to reach out in a
          constructive and sensitive way that works to truly benefit the other
          person. When words do not work, we will learn through the poignant
          example of Jesus how best to communicate. Some of the answers may
          surprise you, but once you know them, it will be apparent why they
          work. As a comfort, we'll also learn some of the practical benefits
          from going through these relational conflicts.</p>

          <strong>Part 3: Fulfilling Male-Female Relationships</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>For the single person: How not only to deal with the heartache of loneliness, but to thrive in singleness.</li>
            <li>For those dating or engaged: How best to delight the other person while protecting the delight of physical love for marriage.</li>
            <li>For those who have blown it sexually: How to rest in God's forgiveness *and* break the patterns that lead to blowing it.</li>
            <li>For those married (now or someday): The secrets for understanding, love, and respect.</li>
            <li>For all: An insightful study of Genesis that reveal what makes each sex "tick", so that we know how best to relate to each other.</li>
          </ul>

          <br><h3>About the Instructors:</h3><hr>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Both Steve and Erica have special gifts to help bring
            these profound insights in the Bible to light. Steve is one of the
            most careful expositors of the Scriptures that I know, and Erica
            has her own sweet way of sharing how these Scriptures apply to our
            down-to-earth lives. The examples given are often taken from their
            own experiences and struggles, and they are very specific and
            practical. What I especially enjoyed was how both shared funny
            situations (at least in hindsight!) that all of us deal with, but
            somehow are seldom communicated with clarity in a large group
            setting.&rdquo;

          <br><h3>Why <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/3870.htm" target="_blank">"Parakaleo"</a>?</h3><hr>
          <p>"Parakaleo" means "to call alongside". A Greek word in the
          original Biblical manuscripts, it can be translated as "counsel", and
          also as "comfort, console, encourage, urge, appeal, exhort" &mdash; all of
          which describe aspects of the counseling process.</p>
          <p>"Parakaleo" appears in the Bible on a list of distinct "gifts of
          the Spirit". Counseling, as all ministry, is done to a certain extent
          by all believers, but some are specially equipped to use this gift as
          their primary ministry in the body of Christ. Our ministry focuses on
          these people, training them to serve in Christian counseling,
          applying scripture actively and practically to the lives of
          believers. These principles are equally valuable in ministering to
          unbelievers in evangelic counseling.</p>
          </p>"Parakaleo" is also the term Jesus chose to designate the Holy
          Spirit in His coming to live in and minister through every Christian
          -- under the Lordship of Christ, using His words. Hence, the
          Parakaleo ministry is also concerned with equipping Christians in
          general to apply God's Word accurately in their lives and in
          ministering to others.</p>
